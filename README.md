Layout training
-Mobile First

lessons learned so far:
- I can see a great potential in CSS frameworks like materialize that do the repetetive work for you. I could make special classes and use em instead of repeating my code.
- My HTLM5 usage of semantic tags is bad. Sections should be used in a different context. See more:

- gotta checkout precisely what font-weights are gonna be used in a project
- I gotta work on naming and structuring the CSS - its horrible.



things to learn:
- why the hell did the text-align: center; worked on an img element? I commented it in CSS  ('.product' selector)
- How should be the 'cite' tag used with 'blockqoute'? I did it like this: 
<blockqoute> lorem100 <cite>author, company</cite><blockqoute>
